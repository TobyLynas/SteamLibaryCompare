# Authentication

For API clients, authentication consists of:

1. Opening a frame at `[..]/auth/steam` that redirects to a `steampowered.com` sign-in page.
2. User enters credentials and completes the OpenID sign-in process.
3. Frame is redirected to return url at `[..]/auth/steam/return` and identifier is verified.
4. Return URL route response serves a page script with an embedded JWT. This is sent via postMessage <small>(format: `{ token: "..." }`)</small> for the web client, but could be manually parsed from the raw response source.
5. Provide JWT via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to authenticate subsequent API requests.
   
Minimal authenticated request example:

 ```http
 GET /proxy/steamworks/IPlayerService/GetOwnedGames/v1/?steamid=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx HTTP/1.1
 Host: localhost:9000
 Connection: keep-alive
 Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
